# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum, designed to apply and practice key concepts like DOM manipulation, modular JavaScript, and clean code organization. The Tic-Tac-Toe game allows two players to compete on a 3x3 grid, with built-in win and draw detection. The project emphasizes user interaction and code reusability, offering a minimalist interface.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Players take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 grid.

- **Restart functionality**: Allows users to reset the game without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive design**: Suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Learning Objectives

This project was built to achieve the following learning outcomes:

- **JavaScript fundamentals**: Deepen understanding of variables, loops, functions, and conditionals.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Gain experience in interacting with HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Learn how to structure JavaScript code using the module pattern to promote maintainability and readability.
- **Event Handling**: Master handling user-generated events, such as mouse clicks, to update the game state.
